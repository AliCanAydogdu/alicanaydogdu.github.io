**Ramme** is a simple jekyll theme.
     
I made this theme after seeing this [screenshot](http://spoonm.org/share/rice/01.png). I took some parts from @mmistakes, like TOC, sample posts. I never tought making a theme from scratch would be this hard. And it's still WIP.
     
I'm not a designer or something, so I'm sure there is a better way to make this theme. But it's working and looks acceptable for different screen sizes. If something looks extremely ugly and you can't resist to fix it, just send me a PR. I will be grateful.
