Throughout my life, I’ve spent significant amount of time on exploring scientific studies on how to improve humans’ wellbeing. This is the main drive that led me to choosing computer science as my field of study. I chose North American University due to the close, professional relationships students can establish with their professors and strengthen their knowledge. While being here, I was determined to achieve success and through my hard work, became a teaching assistant. </p></div><div class="skill-lock"></div></section>
